# Card Number Finder

## Flow Description

The system uses a multi-step approach that includes:
- Image Preprocessing (detecting the card and upscaling)
- Rotating images to align the card with its edges
- Recognizing the text on preprocessed images

The approach is described more thoroughly in the [flow diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14tto3A8LCbSDPgSIpVnahDWFv3PCxNRK/view?usp=sharing).
